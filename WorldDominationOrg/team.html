            <h2><img src="Darkiplier.JPG" alt="Darkiplier" height="300" ></h2>
            <h2>Darkiplier, CEO</h2>
            <blockquote> A fusion of vengeful spirits with a dark entity, Darkiplier is the mastermind behind the majority of the organization's plans. He is most known for being a manipulator of the psyche and 
                becoming capable of interdimensional travel in recent years.
            </blockquote>

            <h2><img src="AntiSepticEye.JPG" alt="AntiSepticEye" height="300" ></h2>
                    <h2>AntiSepticEye, CTO</h2>
                    <blockquote> Our second in command, AntiSepticEye, is a virus spawned from the depths of the rabbitholes within the internet. Through his ability to hack his conciousness into
                        technology, he inevitably managed to possess a physical host through a hacked security camera. Neat!

                    <h2><img src="LordMinion.JPG" alt="LordMinion" height="300" ></h2>
                    <h2>LordMinion, CHRO</h2>
                    <blockquote> A longtime friend of Darkiplier and Bob, LordMinion has been taking in recruits since the organization was first established. 
                        He is frequently referred to by recruits as the <qu>best boss,</qu> and they're almost never threatened into it.

            <h2><img src="Bob.JPG" alt="Blank" height="300" ></h2>
            <h2>Bob, COO</h2>
            <blockquote> Known to be the fairest of the leaders, Bob joined the team when he was tricked into it by Darkiplier. Yet, though he is technically here against his will,
                he is one of the most appreciated assets of our team, spreading the word of our services flawlessly.
